# Database Migration Instructions

## Problem
The application is failing because the database tables don't exist yet. You're seeing this error:
```
relation "public.thumbnails" does not exist
```

## Solution
You need to apply the migration file to your Supabase database. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Access Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the "SQL Editor" section in the left sidebar
3. Click "New Query"

### Step 2: Copy and Execute the Migration
1. Open the file `supabase/migrations/20250707032059_lucky_union.sql` in this project
2. Copy ALL the contents of that file
3. Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click "Run" to execute the migration

### Step 3: Verify Tables Were Created
After running the migration, you should see these tables in your database:
- `thumbnails`
- `clients` 
- `orders`
- `communications`

You can verify this by going to the "Table Editor" section in Supabase and checking that all tables are present.

### Step 4: Test the Application
Once the migration is applied, refresh your application and the thumbnails should load without errors.

## What the Migration Creates
- **thumbnails table**: Stores portfolio thumbnail data
- **clients table**: Manages client information
- **orders table**: Tracks client orders
- **communications table**: Logs client communications
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Proper security policies
- **Indexes**: For better performance
- **Triggers**: For automatic timestamp updates
